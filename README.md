MATLAB implementation of <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10323>A Nonlinear Orthogonal Non-Negative Matrix Factorization Approach to Subspace Clustering</a> A non-negative matrix factorisation based unsupervised clustering algorithm applied to clustering of images (face identity recognition) and general numerical data.

<b>Datasets</b>: We have used the <a href=http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/>UCI Machine Learning Repository</a> data sets and the <a href=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html>Cambridge Computer Laboratory Database of Faces</a> AT&T. The 5 UCI datasets are Soybean, Zoo, Glass, Dermatology and Vehicle. The AT&T face database consists of gray scale face images of 40 persons. Each person has 10 facial images under different light and illumination conditions and the images from the same person belong to the same cluster. The clustering accuracy is evaluated by the common clustering accuracy measure which
computes the percentage of data points that are correctly clustered with respect to the external ground
truth labels.
